            Hello and welcome to my story resumé, this is an exercise for CeroUno.io Apprenticeship Summer Camp for 2018 where I’m learning Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and mostly how to think as a coder.

            Professional Experience
          </h2>
          <p>
            I’ve done a lot of stuff during my life, I’m 32 years old right now and I fortunatenly have been involved in many different industries and initiatives.
          </p>

          <p>  
            I’m currently working at <span class="company">Icalia Labs as theCFO</span>, I'm in charge of Modelling, Revenue forecasting, Accounting, Fiscal & Legal Compliance, Cashflow planning, Credit Management and a whole lot of of other stuff. <strong>We’ve managed to grow the company 80% last year</strong>, and we are hoping to continue that trend, diversifiying services and making improvements on our operations. <u>Something I really like about Icalia is the openness and collaboration of everyone inside the organization</u>, that gives me a window to do a lot of more diverse stuff like tweaking the Legal Framework for it to be more efficient and diminishes risk for the company, doing Business Process Mapping for the operations, setting KPIs on different departments and automating administrative tasks as well.
          </p>

            Academic Background
          </h2>
          <p>
            I really like studying, I believe each time you learn a new topic, it opens you a completely different perspective on what reality is and how the world works.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last time I was in a school was fortunately at the <span class="school">Copenhagen Business School</span> in Denmark, where I got my <strong>Masters Degree of Economics and Business Administration</strong>, it was an amazing time, where I learned lots from amazing teachers who pushed you further with guidance and knowledge. While I was there I had the opportunity to delve deep into a very interesting topic “Neuromarketing”, I ended up writing my thesis about it, specifically, about <u>how to (correctly) use facial expressions in advertising to communicate emotions</u>, I did a framweork and everything, it was really cool.

            Courses & Learning
          </h2>
          <p>
            I’ve been taking courses every now and then, since life has been pushing me to work more and more and get into more projects, my way to satiate my need of knowledge has been through courses.
          </p>
          <p>
          Well, you already know that I’m studying programming right now, but the last couple of courses I took where from coursera, which is a great way to obtain knowledge on several topics.
          </p>
          <p>
          Model thinking was an amazing course that helped me use models to try to communicate abstract ideas, while I also learned from Psychology too which is an amazing topic that makes you learn about the whys of human behavior, that it’s honestly an amazing tool for a world filled with humans.

          <h2>
            Skills & Interests
          </h2>
          <p>
          In all honesty, I’ve always felt that I need to learn more, and that has been one of my weird main interest, this unsatiable need for knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
          Regarding this resumé, I know you need me to tell you the following, I know how to speak and write business english fluently, Spanish too since I was born in México, and I learned a little bit of Danish (I took a 6 month course while in Denmark), and some Swedish to, the next language I’m studying is gonna be French, because I’m interested in living a while over there, it seems like a great place where I can be happy in the coldness of snow, and the warmth of a multicultural society.
          </p>
          <p>
          Regarding my skills, I cannot speak for myself, but others can, and I can tell you what other’s have said, seems fair? I hope so, so here it goes.
        </p>
        <p> 
          People talk to me about new business Ideas so I can bounce with them some insights on where could there be a good business opportunity and what would it take to take advantage of it, and how to structure a potential organization that could achieve the business goals. They seek me for finance guidance, on investing, how to save money, even on topics related of cashflow, collection, taxes, and stuff like that. I also enjoy talking about economics, politics and philosophy, and some people seek to talk weird things questioning the nature of reality and society, which I also really enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my interests, well they are very diverse, I can tell you right now I’m really into meditation (check out the audiobook called the science of enlightenment, it’s amazing) and well, really any kind of knowledge, I’m also always looking for business opportunities, that’s very fun too.
